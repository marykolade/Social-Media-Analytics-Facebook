# Social-Media-Analytics-Facebook

Monitoring social media has become important for companies and organizations around the world. It is an essential tool for innovation and marketing. Its benefits range from the ability to get instant feedback on products and services, allowing better relations with end users and customers, providing a means to increase user satisfaction very quickly, and keeping up with the competition.

This solution accelerator helps developers with all the resources needed to build a Social Media monitoring platform that helps collect data from social media sites and websites and evaluate that data to make business decisions

## Prerequisites
To use this solution accelerator, you will need access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). While not required, a prior understanding of Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Cognitive Services, and Power BI  will be helpful.

For additional training and support, please see:

1. [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/)
2. [Azure Text Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics)
3. [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview)

## Getting Started

### ***Note***
Azure Cogntive Services require to accept the terms and conditions of Responsible AI when they are first provisioned in an Azure subscription. If none of the Cognitive Services were provisioned previously in the Azure subscription, it is necessary to create a temporary cognitive service (for example Language Service) to accept the AI license terms. The service can be dropped after the creation. Once the requirements are in place, the deploy to Azure button can be used to deploy and configure the solution.

The button below will deploy Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Language Service, Azure Translator, Azure Maps and its related resources:

* Go to the [Deployment guide](./Deployment/Deployment.md) to set up your Azure resources for this solution.
